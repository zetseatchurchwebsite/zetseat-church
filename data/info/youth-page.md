       ** Holo Ministry**

      Holo ministry is a counsel and prayer for the sanctification and transformation of all Christians. Its a ministry that brings the gospel to those parts of a believer's heart that have not yer fully believed and cooperated with Christ. Its discipline of digging deep, under the guidance of the **Holy Spirit,** to discover whatever roots might be springing back to life, and to bring them to effective death on the cross. Thus, by forgiving and getting free of wounds and lies, creates an environment for a true intimate relationship with the Godhead.

    description: >-
      God has given this revelation while we were praying before Him to show us
      His heart for teenagers. We have heard of the upcoming revival since from
      we were kids. But, we never understood when and how it is going to happen.


      Aren’t His words and promises true? This was the triggering point for such revelation and prophecy to come from heaven and be revealed to us. God of all creation said to us: ‘**the revival that you are waiting for is waiting for you.**’ I know that is really shocking, right? We said, “how come this is true?”


      Perhaps, God is looking for the next revivalists. Now we have engaged in raise the next new breed of revivalists. The Awakening Conference is prepared to gather those revivalists and equip them by the Word and Spirit of God. 

       **   Mission School** 

      Through history, before God sent His glory and visit the world, He used to fore-send those who would carry the glory or through whom He visits. He calls for people to be sent before He called Himself to visit the world.


      He looks for individuals who are desperate to carry His glory go to the world. A generation who is going to be instruments of God should come first before we see the mighty move of God. **God is looking for a generation to send.**


      > “And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.” 

      >

      > Luke 9:2


      Mission School is intended to equip young missionaries who dedicate their life to carry the message of God to the world. It is a platform that empowers young missionaries and equips them with the Word of God and His Spirit. It provides the basic tools how to fulfill the great commission wherever they are.
