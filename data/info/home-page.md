    Zetseat choir gave birth to the whole image of zetseat church from the
    beginning. This choir started with six members, no band, a single box guitar
    and a keyboard but amazing and glorious worship spirit that has impacted and
    changed many lives. Although now grown in number, the worship highlight
    stays the same, we touch heaven, God moves to change earth!   Exodus
    23:25-26

    God has used this choir to bless individuals, families and nations and will continue to do the same.

    Act of Kindness was officially launched in 2010 by Zetseat Apostolic Reformation Church. It's rooted on the principle in Matthew 25:35 and works to address various socio-economic problems in the community.
