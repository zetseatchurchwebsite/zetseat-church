Do you ever feel weary of spending time with God? Oh, you might not say it that way — and you might not say it out loud — but if we're honest, we'd all admit to experiencing seasons when time spent in prayer or Scripture reading feels more like a boring chore than an intimate connection with the living God.

Maybe we still have our "quiet time" or devotional time or whatever we call it — perhaps out of guilt or because we're afraid not to. Or maybe we don't because it feels like wasted time.

Still, deep down we desperately desire to connect with our Creator. And He wants to connect with us. Figuring out how to do that seems difficult, though. After all, God is God. He's huge and mysterious and greater than us. He's everywhere, yet He's invisible. So we don't connect with God in quite the same way we would with a friend at a coffee shop. Yet He asks us to come and spend time with Him.

So how do we, in the words of Philip Yancey, "reach for the invisible God?" The answer is simple enough: We make it a habit. The trick seems to be keeping our intentional efforts from becoming empty rituals that contain our spiritual efforts rather than enliven them.
